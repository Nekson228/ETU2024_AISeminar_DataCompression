# ETU 2024 AI Seminar on Dimensionality Reduction

This repository contains examples and implementations of various dimensionality reduction techniques.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the datasets used in the examples.
- `docs/`: Contains the theoretical explanations on dimensionality curse and the implemented techniques.
- `models/`: Contains the trained models.
- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter notebooks with the examples.
- `presentation/`: Contains the presentation slides.
- `resources/`: Contains the resources used in the presentation.
- `src/`: Contains the implementations of the dimensionality reduction techniques.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Implemented Techniques

In this repository you can find implementations and theoretical explanations of the following dimensionality reduction techniques:

1. Principal Component Analysis (*PCA*)
2. Kernel PCA (*KPCA*)
3. AutoEncoder (*AE*)
4. Variational AutoEncoder (*VAE*)

## Getting Started

To run the examples, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required packages by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you can run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory, or go through the implementations in the `src/` directory.
